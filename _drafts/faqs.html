        <h3>Why did you start 52 Papers?</h3>
        <p>I have a fascination with the big issues in education, one of which is the research-practice gap. It was stimulated by a research project during my PGCE</p>

        <h3>Background story</h3>
        <p>Towards the end of my PGCE I became increasingly interested in the big issues in education. In particular, the issues that grabbed my attention at that time were teacher recruitment and retention; the research-practice gap; the attainment gap; and the attainment grouping of students.</p>
        <p>At that point it seemed very difficult to see how I could contribute to the solutions of some of those problems. This sentiment was echoed by a colleage, who lamented that it seemed so hard to do anything to influence Whitehall.</p>
        <p>After a weekend of reflection I decided that the best thing to do would be to just start doing <em>something</em>, anthing to get the wheels turning and see what came of it.</p>
        <p>And so, 52 Papers was born: My first attempt at contributing to the big issues in education, by making a small bridge accross the research-practice gap.</p>
