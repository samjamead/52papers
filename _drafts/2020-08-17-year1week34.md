52 Papers is taking a short break to enjoy the end of the summer. We'll be back for the start of the Autumn term, so see you all in Week 36.

## Wait, does this mean that now you're just 50 Papers?

There's been speculation that the website will have to be renamed to accommodate the summer break. It's a good question, but my attention is distracted by the revelation that [2020 has 53 weeks](https://www.epochconverter.com/weeks/2020).  

Apparently it has something to do with [Thursdays and leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date). I think we'll stick to 52 Papers, it has a better ring to it!
